# Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and LSTM-Based Deep Learning Methods:

Author studies machine learning methods, including multivariate linear regression, multivariate adaptive regression spline, random forest, etc and LSTM methods, including univariate and multivariate LSTM method. The conclusion is univariate LSTM model outperforms other methods. The evaluation metrics are productmoment correlation coefficient and root mean square(RMSE)

# Stock Price prediction using deep learning and frequency decomposition

Author proposes a way to predict the stock price. First the stock price data is decomposed into different frequency domains, then CNN is used for feature learning to extract time series features, then LSTM is used to predict the values. Finally the predicted prices are reconstructed with values from LSTM in different frequency domains. The performance shows that the method performs significantly better than LSTM along.
